[![pkgcheck](https://github.com/polskiftw/goonbox-overlay/actions/workflows/pkgcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/polskiftw/goonbox-overlay/actions/workflows/pkgcheck.yml)

A personal Gentoo Portage repository for source-built packages, local packaging fixes, and software that is not available in `::gentoo` in the form wanted on goonbox.

This is an unofficial overlay. Packages are maintained independently from the Gentoo project and their upstream projects.

## Add the repository

Create `/etc/portage/repos.conf/goonbox.conf` as root:

```ini
[goonbox]
location = /var/db/repos/goonbox
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/polskiftw/goonbox-overlay.git
auto-sync = yes
```

Then sync normally:

```sh
emerge --sync
```

Packages from this repository will appear as `::goonbox`.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `games-action/ship-of-harkinian` | Native Linux source build of Ship of Harkinian |

## Repository policy

- Prefer source builds over repackaged binaries.
- Pin upstream source revisions used by versioned packages.
- Do not permit network access during configure, compile, or install phases.
- Keep writable user data out of Portage-managed system paths.
- Use existing Gentoo system libraries where practical.
- Use thin Manifests and inherit `::gentoo` as the repository master.
- New packages should pass `pkgcheck scan` before being considered ready.
- Nintendo ROMs, extracted copyrighted game assets, credentials, and other private data do not belong in this repository.

## Local development

A convenient workflow is to keep a writable clone in your home directory while Portage syncs its own copy:

```text
~/src/goonbox-overlay
        |
        | git push
        v
GitHub
        |
        | emerge --sync
        v
/var/db/repos/goonbox
        |
        v
Portage
```

Useful QA tools:

```sh
emerge -av app-portage/pkgdev
pkgcheck scan
pkgdev manifest
```
